# Metro Station Management System

## Introduction
The Metro Station Management System is designed to optimize metro operations and route planning using data structures and algorithms. It enhances efficiency by automating the management of stations, routes, and passenger flow. This project is built as part of a Data Structures and Algorithms internship.

## Project Overview
This system simulates core functionalities of a metro network including station handling, pathfinding, and scheduling. It is implemented in Java using DSA concepts like Graphs, Heaps, and HashMaps. The project enables real-time route optimization and efficient travel recommendations.

## Key Features
- Station addition, deletion, and search functionality.
- Shortest path calculation between stations using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Route planning and scheduling simulation.

## Technologies Used
- **Java:** Main programming language for implementing the model.
- **Data Structures:** ArrayList, HashMap, PriorityQueue.
- **Algorithms:** Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Graph traversal.

## Model Architecture
The metro system is modeled as a weighted graph where:
- Nodes represent metro stations.
- Edges represent routes with weights as distances or time.
- Dijkstra’s algorithm is applied to compute the shortest path.
- HashMaps are used for quick station lookup and adjacency representation.

## Dataset and Training
- Custom-defined metro station data.
- Simulated metro map with stations and connections.
- Manual testing with varied route queries and network sizes.

## Results
- Successfully computes shortest and optimized paths.
- Ensures quick station access and management.
- Scalable design for adding more stations and features.

## Future Work
- Integration with real-time metro APIs for live tracking.
- GUI implementation for user-friendly interaction.
- Fare calculation and passenger flow prediction modules.
